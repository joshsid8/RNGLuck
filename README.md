# RNGLuck
This is a random number generator that 'spins' until it gets a specified lucky number! use this for games that require spinning for a price!

# % Chance

This is the number the spinner will spin until. if you choose the number to be 25, for example, it will keep spinning until it hits that number or less. 

NOTICE: pick a number between 10,000 and 1.
1 is 0.01 percent
10 = 0.1 percent
100 is 1 percent
1000 = 10 percent
10,000 = 100 percent (certain)
0 = impossible, but it will give a randomly high number anyway...

# Price of each spin

This is an optional feature, but can be useful for anything that includes a price when spinning for something. you get to know how much has been spent after you get a lucky number.

# Budget

This is an optional feature, but useful for any games you play that includes luck. If you want to add a certain amount of credits, you can know how much you have left, or if you have gone over it. It helps you know if you're amount is enough for your desired item.

# Final Words

This was made using Autohotkey, my first steps for my social engineering career and stuff >:)
This seems to be my first ever solo repository on Github, so expect basic stuff here.
